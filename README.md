# Card Deck Simulation in Python

This Python script simulates a deck of 52 playing cards. It includes two main classes: `Card` and `Deck`. The `Card` class represents an individual card, while the `Deck` class represents a full deck of shuffled cards. The deck allows cards to be dealt randomly.

## Features
- **Card Class**: Represents a playing card with a rank (e.g., Ace, 2, King) and suit (e.g., Hearts, Spades).
- **Deck Class**: Represents a standard 52-card deck, shuffling the cards upon initialization.
- **Dealing Cards**: Cards can be dealt one by one from the deck, with each card removed from the deck upon being dealt.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
